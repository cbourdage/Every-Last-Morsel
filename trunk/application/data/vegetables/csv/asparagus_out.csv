Edsbest I|Edward L. Nigh, Jr.|Arizona Ag Con.|cold tolerance, early emergence; spears large and straight with slightly tapered tight tips; dark green, adapted to hot desert climates; reduced susceptibility to Fusarium spp. and rust; exceptional yields during hot harvest climates resulting from late emerging branchlets.||||four way cross UC 157 FI male (AZ 75-C) + Wash 500 (AZ 91) = AZ 82-J x UC 157 F1 female (AZ-73) + Brock male (IVB 73-B) = AZ-80C.
Edsbest II|Edward L. Nigh, Jr.|Arizona AgCon.|early emergence following cold temperatures; tolerance to excessive desert climate, reduced susceptibility to Fusarium attributed to stress; dark green, straight spears; tips tight and slightly tapered, bracts tight; high yield due to early through late harvests.||||Brock male(IVB-75)+UC 157F1 female (AZ-73) = AZ-82 H x Male NJ Giant (F1), AZ-85.
