Pickworth Pinkeye|Auburn University, Auburn, AL.||erect, determinate growth habit with limited lateral vines; pods are slightly curved, average 25 cm in length, are slightly constricted about the seed, have a glossy surface, produce about 14 seed per pod, and are borne concentrated above the plant; pod color is green when immature, changing to reddish-purple at the mature-green stage; the peas are kidney shaped, medium to large in size (18 to 24 g per 100 seed), and have a distinct, non-bleeding pink eye. Distinguished from Alagreen Pinkeye by the presence of both green and white seeds (approximately half of the plants produce peas with a dry green seed coat and the other half produce peas with a white seed coat).||for use in Alabama 'because of its special appeal to pick-your-own consumers, as well as fresh-market production for wholesale lots in the pod or retail sale of shelled peas.'
